## 2026-05-14 — Session 1 Complete

### Summary

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Environment setup | ✅ | RTX 5090, Python 3.14, venv, qwen-tts installed |
| Phase A — Baseline inference | ✅ | WAV output working, RTF measured |
| Phase D — Megakernel build | ✅ | Kernel patched, JIT built, single decode step confirmed |
| Phase D — Full integration | ❌ Blocked | Prefill/vocoder boundary (see findings.md) |
| Phase C — Pipecat pipeline | ⏳ Not started | Next priority |
| Phase B — Real streaming | ⏳ Not started | After Phase C |

### Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Baseline RTF (HF, no megakernel, no flash-attn) | **0.879** |
| Target RTF | < 0.15 |
| Speedup needed | ~6× |
| Audio sample rate | 24000 Hz |
| EOS token ID | 2150 |
| Model load time | ~5800 ms |
| GPU | RTX 5090, CUDA 12.8 |

### Phase D Blocker

The megakernel single decode step works (`step(0) → token 112` confirmed). Full loop integration is blocked by:

1. **Prefill incompatibility** — HF talker prefill uses `inputs_embeds` (mixed text + codec + speaker float tensors). Megakernel only accepts integer token IDs. No clean handoff point.
2. **No public vocoder API** — `Qwen3TTSModel.generate_custom_voice()` buries the speech tokenizer (vocoder) call internally. No exposed method to run vocoder on custom codec token sequences.

Both require deep reverse-engineering of `qwen_tts` internals. Deferred to next session.

## Next Session Priorities

- [ ] **Phase C** — Wire Pipecat pipeline end-to-end (STT → LLM → TTS → speaker)
  - Server scaffold ready: `server/pipeline/voice_agent.py`
  - Needs: LLM API key (OpenAI or Anthropic), STT choice (Deepgram key or Whisper local)
- [ ] **flash-attn** — `pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation` then re-run baseline (quick RTF improvement)
- [ ] **Phase D continued** — Explore accessing `qwen_tts` vocoder internals to complete megakernel loop
- [ ] **README** — Write with real numbers once demo is working
