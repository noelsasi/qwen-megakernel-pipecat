RTX 5090 Decode Megakernel → Qwen3-TTS on Pipecat

*Expected time: \< 1 day with a good LLM coding agent*

## **TL;DR**

**Take AlpinDale’s qwen\_megakernel** (a \~1,200-line CUDA megakernel that runs Qwen3-0.6B at 1,000 tok/s on a single RTX 5090\) and wire it up to serve **Qwen3-TTS** inference inside a **Pipecat** voice pipeline.

## **Reference Material**

* Blog post:  blog.alpindale.net/posts/5090\_decode\_optimization/

* Source code:  github.com/AlpinDale/qwen\_megakernel

* Pipecat docs:  docs.pipecat.ai

* Qwen3-TTS:  huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS

## **What the Megakernel Does (Context)**

* **Architecture:** 128 persistent thread blocks × 512 threads, launched as a single non-cooperative kernel

* **Model:** Qwen3-0.6B in bfloat16 (no quantization)

* **Performance:** \~1,000 tok/s decode (0.97 ms/step), 71% of theoretical GDDR7 bandwidth

* **Output:** single-token argmax per step (autoregressive decode loop on host)

# **The Task**

### **Goal**

Get the megakernel running as the LLM decode backend for Qwen3-TTS’s **talker decoder** (not the codebook generator), **streaming real-time speech synthesis into a Pipecat voice agent pipeline.**

### **Performance Targets**

* **TTFC (time to first audio chunk): \< 60 ms**

* **RTF (real-time factor): \< 0.15** — i.e. generating 1 second of audio must take less than 300 ms

* The output **must be streaming to Pipecat** — push audio chunks as they’re decoded, do NOT buffer the full utterance before sending

* These are reference benchmarks for a good submission, not pass/fail cutoffs — but if you’re way off, explain why

## **Step 1 — Adapt the Megakernel for Qwen3-TTS**

* Clone github.com/AlpinDale/qwen\_megakernel

* Qwen3-TTS uses the same Qwen3 architecture for its talker decoder stage — this is the target, not the codebook generator

## **Step 2 — Build the Inference Server**

* Expose a simple streaming interface:  prompt in → token stream out

## **Step 3 — Integrate with Pipecat**

* Wire it into a basic Pipecat pipeline:  STT → LLM → your TTS service → audio output

## **Step 4 — Validate End-to-End**

* Run a round-trip test: speak → transcribe → LLM response → TTS → audio playback

* Measure and report: tokens/sec from the megakernel, TTFC (target \< 50 ms), RTF (target \< 0.1), overall latency

* Confirm audio is streaming to Pipecat frame-by-frame — not buffered-then-sent

* Confirm audio quality is acceptable (no glitches, dropped frames)

## **Deliverables**

1. **Working repo** with build instructions (should work on a single RTX 5090\)

2. **Short README** documenting: architecture decisions, any kernel modifications, how to run the Pipecat demo

3. **Performance numbers** — decode tok/s, TTFC (target \< 90 ms), RTF (target \< 0.3), end-to-end latency

4. **Demo recording** showing the voice agent working with you talking end to end

## **What We’re Evaluating**

* **Ramp-up speed** — how quickly and effectively you get up to speed and understand unfamiliar topics (CUDA kernels, TTS pipelines, Pipecat). We don’t expect you to already know all of this

* **Performance rigor** — how thorough and honest your benchmarking and reporting is. Show us real numbers, methodology, and where the bottlenecks are. Don’t hand-wave

* **Coding agent proficiency** — how extensively and effectively you leverage a modern LLM coding agent. We recommend Claude Code or Codex. **We will cover the costs** — don’t hold back on usage

* **Communication** — clear README, honest about what works and what’s rough

## **Timing**

**With a good LLM coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), this should take less than a day.**

The megakernel already works. Qwen3-TTS is a known architecture. Pipecat has documented service interfaces. The work is integration, not research. If you’re spending more than a day, you’re probably overcomplicating it.

### **Notes**

* You’ll need an RTX 5090 (the kernel is tuned for sm\_120 / Blackwell). We recommend renting one on [Vast.ai](http://vast.ai/pricing/gpu/RTX-5090): — we will reimburse compute costs

* The megakernel is bfloat16 only — don’t try to add quantization, that’s not the point

* If the talker decoder’s backbone is a different size than 0.6B, document what you changed in the kernel and why

* Bonus points: if you find a way to improve the megakernel’s performance during integration, tell us about it
